    "Methods such as PMI, LSA, and Word2Vec sound like they could be capturing important semantic information, but up until now, you've had to take our word for it.  In this lab, you'll be evaluating the quality of several of these methods by calculating their similarity to a hand-derived word-similarity dataset.  You won't achieve perfect similarity scores (even human annotators rarely agree exactly about semantic similarity), but you will see that the quality can vary significantly between methods.\n",

Before you do this, you will want to review **the creation of sparse matrices from DSCI 512** (`scipy.sparse.dok_matrix` (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.dok_matrix.html)). Importantly, you should create a **symmetric matrix** where both the row $n$ and the column $n$ refer to the same word type. For this, you will also want to create a lookup from words to indices in the array called `word_index_lookup`; you can use the words in the document frequency dictionary you built in **Exercise 0**.

See [here](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.16.0/reference/generated/scipy.sparse.csr_matrix.html#scipy.sparse.csr_matrix) for the methods available to do elementwise operations on the CSR sparse matrix. you can't use normal numpy array operators for most of this.

    "Many ML models have a number of so-called \"hyper-parameters\" that can be tuned to affect model quality.  We've seen a few of these in class, such as window size and number of iterations.  Some of these parameters can have a significant effect on the quality of the model, and should be tuned on a development set - for this lab, we'll replicate process of hyper-parameter tuning by evaluating results on your gold standard.  Note that this is typically a bad way of doing things!  When you tune on your test set, you are biasing it towards the data in your test set, and your reported results may be artificially high.  In real experiments, you should separate out another small set to serve as a ``development`` or ``tuning`` set. \n",

    "Explore the parameter space of the word2vec model. You should at least consider the following parameters (see the [docs](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html#gensim.models.word2vec.Word2Vec)): iter, size, window, sg, and negative. You will need to show evidence that you have found good (if not great) parameter settings (make sure you test a good range of values!  One way to find suitable values to test is to look at the documentation, and see what the default value is.  Increase and decrease that value to explore preliminary values, and then keep increasing or decreasing it in the direction of improvement), and discuss what you found in the box below -- some parameters are going to have more of an effect than others. It's okay to optimize the parameters one at a time (the order provided in the list above is a fine one to proceed with).  One strategy is to optimize the first parameter, then \"lock\" that parameter to the discovered value, and try tuning the second parameter, etc.  That said, you're free to optimize in other ways. To speed things up, you might want to use the worker option (which allows multiprocessing), and the seed option could be useful to eliminate random variation (ie, if the seed is identical in each run, improvements are more likely due to the change of parameter you made, instead of random seed variation). You should be able to get the highest performance among all the options tested in this lab. (Garrett's best numbers are ~0.5)  You probably only need a few lines of code for each of these experiments, but they may take a while, especially as you increase the number of iterations, window size, etc."
